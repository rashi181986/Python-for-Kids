# sqlite3 lets Python create and read database files.
# Here we build a small cricket database with three tables:
# Team, Match, and Player_Match — then connect to it.

# sqlite_master is a special built-in table that lists
# every table stored inside the database.

# ---- PART 3: SELECT Rows and Columns ----
# SELECT * fetches every column from a table.

# ---- PART 4: Filter Rows with WHERE ----
# WHERE keeps only the rows that match a condition —
# like a sieve that lets some rows through and blocks others.
# AND combines two conditions (both must be true).
# IN lets you list several allowed values in one go.

# ---- PART 5: Search for a Pattern with LIKE ----
# LIKE searches for a pattern inside a text column.
# % means zero or more of any character.
# 'De%' matches any name that starts with the letters De.
# LIKE always goes inside a WHERE clause.

# Find all teams whose name begins with 'De'

# ---- PART 6: Find the Smallest and Largest Values ----
# MIN() returns the smallest value in a column.
# MAX() returns the largest value in a column.
# Write both inside SELECT to compare them in one result.

# Find the narrowest and biggest win margins ever recorded
